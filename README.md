# Movie-suggestion
Movie recommendation system


For the first part i am using the dataset the MovieLens Tag Genome Dataset 2021

it has 10.5 million computed tag-movie relevance scores from a pool of 1,084 tags applied to 9,734 movies. Released 12/2021. This dataset also contains input necessary to generate the tag genome using both the original process (Vig et al. 2012) and a more recent improvement (Kotkov et al. 2021)

#HOW TO RUN THE CODE

1. Download the dataset from the link below: https://files.grouplens.org/datasets/tag-genome-2021/genome_2021.zip

2. Extract the files and place them in the same folder as the code

3. Install libraries (might be more): 
```bash
pip3 install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```
